#In Python, one-liner if-else statements are known as ternary operators or conditional operators. For example:

age = 30
age_group = "Adult" if age > 18 else "Child"
print(age_group)

#Output:
#Adult

#Generally, a conditional operator follows this pattern for your convenience:

true_expression if condition else false_expression
